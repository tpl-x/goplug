modules:
  # Each module entry defines a path, which must be relative to the directory where the
  # buf.yaml is located. You can also specify files or directories to exclude from a module.
  # Directories across modules cannot overlap. For example, "a" and "a/b" cannot be two paths
  # to modules in a given workspace.
